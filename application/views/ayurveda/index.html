	    <h3 class="marg-top-med">Ayurveda Definition</h3>
	    <p>Ayurveda is the science of life. The term "Ayur" means life and "Veda" means science or knowledge. Ayurveda is not merely a system of medicine but a way of life, a science that offers man a means to live his life to the full. According to Indian philosophy, human life has four purposes, Dharma (perform one's duty), Artha (to amass enough wealth), Kama (to fulfil one's wishes) and Moksha (to attain salvation). To accomplish these four goals one needs perfect health and Ayurveda suggests the ways and means to attain and maintain ideal health and the quality of life.</p>
	    <p>Internal cleansing removes the cause or root of an illness and corrects the imbalance of the bio-energies. Internal cleansing therapy normalizes the physical constitution and calms the three bio-energies.</p>
	    <h3 class="marg-top-med">Two Broad Divisions of Ayurveda</h3>
	    <p>1. Swasthavritha aims at maintaining health by practising a proper life style designed for the changing seasons and the health status as well as the constitution of the individual. Dinacharya (daily routine) and Rithucharya (seasonal routine) form the basis of Ayurvedic preventive health care. Ayurvedic texts provide comprehensive instructions about the lifestyle to be followed from the birth to death of a human being.</p>
	    <p>2. Athuravritha is the part dealing with diseases and their management. Various diseases, their aetiology, prodromal symptoms, signs and symptoms, treatment and prognosis are all described in detail.</p>
	    <h3 class="marg-top-med">History and Evolution</h3>
	    <p>The practise of medicine dates back to the primitive man searching for roots and plants that can cure his ailments. Like all ancient healthcare practises, the science of Ayurveda also evolved with the human race. Ayurveda as we perceive now is a compilation of the accumulated knowledge and experiences of generations, refined through extensive discussions which was later documented in a well organised format by established schools of the age. One distinct advantage of Ayurveda is its sound theoretical framework based on Indian philosophy of life which distinguishes it from folk medicine.</p>

	    <h3 class="marg-top-med">The Concept of Divine Origin Authentic Text Books of Ayurveda</h3>
	    <p>The most authentic books in Ayurveda are Charakasamhitha, Susruthasamhitha, Astangasamgraham and Astangahrudayam. Other significant texts include Kasyapasamhita, Madhavanidanam, Chakradatham, Sargadharasamhita, Bhaishayaratnavali, Bhavaprakasam, Rasaratnasamuchayam and Rasaratnakaram. Through the Centuries the chaotic geopolitical developments and frequent wars and conquests have resulted in the destruction of many of these treasured traditions of natural medicine. But Ayurveda managed to withstand the turmoil and actually benefited from its exposure to other systems of medicine. Social developments like the rise and fall of Buddhism also left its impact on the science. The practise of surgery became extinct as the Buddhist principle of Ahimsa prohibited all procedures which involved blood shedding. Even during the British rule in India, the patriotic zeal of the people, their leaders and benevolence of the rulers of Princely States initiated the revival of Ayurvedic system of medicine.</p>
