                 <h3>Relaxation Therapies</h3>
                 <p>Abhyangam – meaning oil massage in Sanskrit – is an effective therapy for conditioning of body in ancient Ayurveda. The oils for massage are extracted from vegetable oils that are infused with Ayurveda herbs. This relaxing and refreshing full body massage is a masterpiece of Kerala Ayurveda. It is done with medicated herbal oils by two therapists in a synchronized manner for 45 minutes. The number of strokes and pressure vary with the condition of the individual. This massage is indicated daily to prevent aging and degeneration. This seven-position therapy will treat the whole body physically, mentally and emotionally while balancing the doshas.</p>
                 <p>Shirodhara is a form of Ayurveda therapy that involves gently pouring liquids over the forehead and can be one of the steps involved in Panchakarma. The name comes from the Sanskrit words shiro (head) and dhara (flow). Sirodhara is an effective therapy for mental relaxation and cures insomnia, stress, depression, and decreased mental agility. The procedure is also said to synchronize alpha brain waves, enhance blood circulation to the brain, improve mental clarity and generally releasing deeply trapped ama, or toxins.</p>
                 <p>The ‘Pizhichil’ is a specialized type of Ayurvedic massage which combines 2 method of therapies, mainly heat therapy and oil therapy. It mainly involves the process of pouring or squeezing of warm medicated oils from a piece of cloth soaked in medicated oil on to the patient’s body and at the same time the patient is given a gentle, rhythmic massage. Thus this massage is a blend of both the goodness of medicated oil and heat. When the herbal oils is massaged on to the body, its healing components are absorbed directly in to our body through the skin and the massage improves that blood circulation and helps to balance mind and body. The other benefit, which is the heat therapy is that it is best suited to relieve pain and relax muscles. It is very much recommended for extremely high Vata dosha.</p>
                 <p>A generous amount of medicated oil is applied to the whole body and then the body is massaged with small cotton cloth boluses filled with cooked Njavara rice. The boluses are dipped in this regenerating mixture of cow s milk and a brewed herbal decoration, and then applied all over the body to induce sudation (sweat). This procedure is highly rejuvenating, nourishing and prepares the individual to bear the stresses and strains of a busy lifestyle. It enhances physical consistency, strengthens the nervous system and improves the overall appearance of the skin.</p>
                 <p>Choorna swedam is an ayurvedic treatment for neurological disorders, rheumatism and arthritis. In this treatment, the whole body is vigorously massaged with herbal powder (choornam) tied into tiny bundles in muslin cloth until the warmth induces the skin to sweat. The sweat washes away toxic body wastes and unnecessary body fluids. This therapy helps curing the "Kapha Vata" predominant conditions of back and muscular pain.</p>
